Hi, I\'m 7z7, a code monkey from China. I got master degree in computer science from Beihang University, and now am working in Microsoft Research Asia.

I have great interests in frond-end development, and am constantly honing my FE skills, as well as my BE skills -- be a full-stack dev.

I\'m also fond of design, babystepping on PS.

I\'m on the way to be a computartist.
