[Understanding Progressive Enhancement](http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement)中看到了这句话:  

> Concerned with content availability, overall accessibility, and mobile browser capabilities, they sought a new way to approach web development—a way that focused on the content and did more than just **pay lip service to** older devices.

[淘宝UED](http://ued.taobao.org/blog/2008/10/understanding-progressiveen-hancement-chs-translation/)的翻译是:

> 他们致力于改善内容可利用性 (Content Availability)、全局可访问性 (Overall Accessibility) 和移动设备浏览器的能力，并为 Web 开发寻觅到一条新的途径 —— 一条聚焦于内容并能为旧设备提供更多实际支持的途径。

The Free Dictionary有两个词条:

1. [pay lip service](http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/pay+lip+service)
    **to express loyalty, respect, or support for something insincerely.**
    *You don't really care about politics. You're just paying lip service to the candidate.*  
    *Don't sit here and pay lip service. Get busy!*

2. [pay lip service to](http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/pay+lip+service+to)
    **to say that you agree with and support an idea or plan but not do anything to help it to succeed**
    *The company pays lip service to the notion of racial equality but you look around you and all you see are white faces.*

看起来是"怠慢, 敷衍"的意思.

那么什么是"lip service"呢? [Merriam Webster - lip service](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lip%20service)写道:

> support for someone or something that is expressed by someone in words but that is not shown in that person's actions

就是嘴上功夫啊!
