<div class="item" style="white-space: pre-line;">
  Hi, I'm 7z7, a code monkey from China. I got master degree in computer science from Beihang University, and now am working in Microsoft Research Asia.
  
  I have great interests in frond-end development, and am constantly honing my FE skills, as well as my BE skills -- be a full-stack dev.
  
  I'm also fond of design, babystepping on PS.
  
  I'm on the way to be a computartist.
